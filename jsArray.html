    <h2>JS Array</h2>
    <p>Array is a Javascript special variable that can store more than one value</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <p id="demo1"></p>
    <script>
        // let ca1='volvo'
        // let car2='benz'
        // let car3='hummer'
        // document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML= 'My cars are: ' +ca1 +' ' +car2 + ' ' +car3
        const cars=['Volvo','Hummer','Benz']

        cars[1]='Rav4'
         // adding an array we use push method:
        cars.push('Toyoya')
        
        //accessig an array
        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML='My car types are: ' +cars
        //array lenght is used to return the numbers of element:cars.length
        
        //accessing an array element reffering to its index value

        document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML= 'This car is expensive: ' + cars[1]

       

        
     
    </script>
    <p>An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.</p>
    <p>Using an array literal is the esiest way to create Javascript array</p>
    <p>Syntax:Const arrayName= [item1,item2,item3,...] and it is a common practice to declare an array with the const keyword</p>
<p>You can access an array element by referring to its index number</p>
<pre>Arrays are Objects
    Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
    
    But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.
    
    Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] 
    Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName

    Array Elements Can Be Objects
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array
