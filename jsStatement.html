    <h2>JavaScript and Camel Case</h2>
    Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
    
    Hyphens:
    
    first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.
    
    Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
    Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.


Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
